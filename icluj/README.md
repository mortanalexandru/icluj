## ITBrainiacs - [more info](http://www.apex-edu.ro/index_en.html)
The IT Brainiacs program developed was by Apex-Edu and Telenav based on two main ideas: the need for early identification of talented children or adolescents in the field of IT and the development of an intervention that will harness their potential. This would be a genuine intervention and, most of all, formative, an experience that will change everyone involved.

We chose the mentoring path both for the benefits of an intense personal relationship, revealed by the children’s’ personalized learning experience and for the benefits of being a mentor. In this way, we created a link between excellent students and keen developers, which involved a strong engagement for learning and training.
